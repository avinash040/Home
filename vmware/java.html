      <h2>Alerting Engine</h2>
      <p>I implemented the Alerting Engine component of VMware's SMARTS root cause analysis platform. Configuration was loaded from YAML files, templates were defined in JSON, and REST schemas were built using Swagger. The alert processing pipeline first leveraged Kafka Streams before transitioning to Apache Flink.</p>

      <h2>Velocloud Data Collector</h2>
      <p>Developed a REST-based data collector that ingests metrics from the Velocloud SD-WAN solution and feeds them into SMARTS. The work involved mastering SD-WAN concepts and defining thresholds and alarms that map to orchestrator data.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Kafka Connector</h2>
      <p>Implemented a Kafka connector interface enabling SMARTS to interact seamlessly with Kafka as part of the alerting infrastructure.</p>
